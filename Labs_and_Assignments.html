<h1><a href="http://www.site.uottawa.ca/~tcl/seg2105/">SEG 
2105</a> Labs and Assignments (subject to change)</h1>
</center>

For all of these assignments, see the <a
href="2105SyllabusSep2009.pdf">official syllabus</a> for
master deadline dates and lab times. Note that these instructions and
the dates are subject to change; any changes will be announced to students
by email and/or on the <a 
href="http://www.site.uottawa.ca/~tcl/seg2105/">course home 
page.</a> Such announcements supercede anything shown in the syllabus.<p>

Note: Answers to these questions will not, generally, be posted on the web 
in any form. This is necessary since students in other universities are 
also doing these exercises. The answers will, however, be discussed in 
detail by your lab TA, when the assignments are handed back.<p>

<b>Handing in assignments</b>: Your TAs will give you instructions about
how to hand in assignments.
The TAs will also check the boxes about 2 days later, and
deduct 25% from any assignments that are that late. Assignments later than
that will not count.<p>

<b>Marking method and discussion of results</b>: Your lab TA will mark the
assignments and hand them back in the lab period. 
If you have complaints about the marking, please first
discuss the problem with the TA who marked it.  Only come to the professor
once the TA has looked at an assignment and has written a comment on it
that says he/she refuses to change it. <p>

<b>Rules on cheating and working together:</b> The individual assignments
must be done strictly on your own; you may only ask the TA for help. The
group assignments must be done only with your partner and you must both
share the design, programming and writing work. Any sharing or copying of
any part of your work with others will result in an immediate 5% penalty
on your final course grade as well as zero on the assignment. TAs will be
instructed to immediately report any cheating to me. As an additional
disincentive to cheating, midterm and exam questions will relate to the
labs and assignments.<p>

<h2>Lab 1 started in the first lab (and assignment 1)</h2>

<b>Lab date:</b> Mon Sep 14 2009 or Thurs Sep 17 2009<p>

This will be handed in as assignment 1, by 12:50 on Mon Sep 28 2009.<p>

<b>Group work and partners</b>: In this lab, and all other labs that
involve programming, you will work in groups of two. If you have not
previously arranged to work with someone in your lab section, then you
will have to find someone immediately. If there are an odd number of
students, the TA may permit an individual to work alone for now. No groups
of 3 will be permitted.<p>

<b>Seating</b>: In the early labs, each group will use one computer, 
although you will need an extra computer when you are doing later labs 
involving client-server work.<p>

<b>Saving work and accounts</b>: Your TA will give you any needed help 
regarding setting up your account. Before you leave the lab each day, 
make sure you have saved your work.<p>

<b>Using Eclipse</b>: You will be using Eclipse in this lab.<a 
href="http://www.site.uottawa.ca/~tcl/seg2105/coursenotes/Lab1_Getting_Started.html"> 
Instructions on how to get started in the lab can be found here.</a><p>

<b>Exercises to do</b>: Work on the following exercises from the textbook.
You must hand in only one copy of answers per group. Make sure the names
and student numbers of both partners are clearly indicated. You must
work on these questions during the lab and then finish off
the work on your own time.<p>

<hr>
<ol>

<li>Before coming to the lab you were asked to read and understand Section
2.9 of the textbook. If you have not done this, take five minutes now to
do it.<p>

<li>To start this lab, download the code for the PointCP example 
available
at <a
href="http://www.site.uottawa.ca/school/research/lloseng/supportMaterial/source/">http://www.site.uottawa.ca/school/research/lloseng/supportMaterial/source/.</a><br>
Compile the code and run it.<p>

<li>By modifying the original version, implement both design 3 and design 
5. 
When you hand in the lab, you will hand in the code you have written.<p>

<li>Modify the PointCPTest class to allow you to test the two designs 
you have developed. Do a thorough series of tests to ensure
your classes and interface work properly. You will hand in the code, and
also a printout of the output generated by your tests.<p>

<li>Hand in your answers to exercises E26 (table of what you think will be the
advantages and disadvantages of each design), and E28-E30 (performance analysis, comparing 
Design 4 with Design 5, instead of Design 1 with Design 5 as the book says).
Hand in a description of how you did the tests,
sample outputs from running the tests, the table and a discussion of the
results. <p>

Hint: To measure execution time of a method, you can execute it
many thousands of times, and then find the elapsed time in milliseconds. You should execute
each design enough times so the program takes about 10 seconds to run.
Look in the Java documentation for the currentTimeMillis() method. To test
two different designs you can simply run the code, timing the results for
the first design. Then edit the code to use the new class (and
constructor), and compile and run it again. We suggest you run each 
version several times to ensure that your results are consistent. If they are not consistent, take the
median result as your definitive result and list the other results..<p>

<h2>Assgnment 2 </h2>

Due Oct 9, 2009, 15:30. This is an individual assignment. You must 
work strictly alone on this.<p>

Hand in answers to the following. It is suggested that you do the questions from Chapter 2 before Oct 5, and do the question from Chapter 5 around Oct 8 after we have covered the material in the lectures<p>

<ol>

<li>E5 (page 35), parts d, f and g<p>

<li>E6 (page 36), part c<p>

<li>E7 (page 37), parts d and e<p>

<li>E9 (page 39), part c<p>

<li>E12 (pages 43-45), parts f and h<p>

<li>E15 (page 50), part b<p>

<li>E18 (page 51), parts b and e<p>

<li>E45 (page 81), part e<p>

<li>From Chapter 5: Create a class diagram for the following system. Show classes, associations and generalizations: A student club wants to keep track of its members and the activities they have signed up for. Each member has a name, email address and program of studies. Each activity has a date, title, description and maximum number of participants. Some of the members are executives, for each of these, the system must record their position (e.g. predident, vice president, etc. as well as their phone number. Some of the activities are for executive members only, and some require a fee. The system must record who has paid the fee and the date that fee was paid.<p>

<p>

<h2>Lab 2 and 3  (and assignment 3)</h2>
  
<b>Lab dates:</b> Mondays Sep 21/28 or Thursdays Sep 24, Oct 1.<p>

This will be handed in as assignment 3, by 15:30. on Oct 16, 2009.<p>

<a 
href="http://www.site.uottawa.ca/~tcl/seg2105/coursenotes/Lab2_Getting_Started.html">Instructions 
for setting up the OCSF and SimpleChat code in Eclipse are 
found here:  
href="http://www.site.uottawa.ca/~tcl/seg2105/coursenotes/Lab2_Getting_Started.html.</a><p>

Note you have a reasonably long amount of time to do this; I
suggest you get as much as you can done in the lab period this week and
next week, and then start working on it as homework so that the final week
you are only asking the TA some leftover questions.<p>

<b>Group work and partners</b>: For this lab, you may have a different 
partner from the one you had for the first lab, but please only do so 
after discussing with your TA. In particular, do not abandon your partner 
without ensuring your partner has someone else to work with. You must work 
with the same partner from this point onwards in the course, unless your 
partner drops the course.<p>

<b>Purpose of the lab</b> These lab questions are designed to help you 
become very familiar with the design of the SimpleChat program and the 
OCSF framework. You should read the relevant sections of the textbook 
before coming to the lab. You will be tested on your understanding of 
SimpleChat and OCSF in the midterm.<p>

<b>Exercises to do:</b> You will do exercises listed below from pages 
104-107 of the textbook with a few modifications to ensure that the work 
you do is a little different from the work of last year.<p>

<ol>

<li>E48, page 104 (5 marks): Do only testcases 1001 to 1009. Hand in a statement listing the test case number and
   'Success: Results as expected' or 'Failure: results .....'<p>

<li>E49, pages 104-105 (25 marks):  Hand in changes to your code with each preceded by a comment so the TA can see what you changed for this question. Your comment should look something like this '// **** Changed 
for E48' and your initials. Furthermore, add normal code comments 
explaining
anything non-obvious in what you are doing.<p>


<li>E50, pages 105-106 (30 marks): As before, comment each change as you go.<p>

<li>E51, pages 106-107 (30 marks): As before, comment each change as you go.<p>

<li>E52, page 107 (10 marks): Hand in a statement listing the test case number
   and 'Success: Results as expected' or 'Failure: results .....'
   If you have bugs in your code that result in failed testcases, you
   will still get marks here. You will lose marks, however, if your
   results are 'faked' in any way.<p>

</ol>


<b>What to hand in</b>: Hand in the following: 1) A document containing the test cases for E48 (1001 to 1009) and E52. 2) Your entire simplechat *directory* (DO NOT submit the OCSF framework directory). Following the additional instructions from your TA. <p>


<hr>


<h2>Lab 4, UML and Umple.</h2>

<b>Lab dates:</b> Monday Oct 5 or Thurs, Oct 8.<p>

The TA will given you an exercise in UML to code in Umple. There is no lab report for this lab, however attendance will be taken.<p>


<hr>



<h2>Assgnment 4 </h2>

Due Oct 26, 2009, 12:50. This is an individual assignment. You must 
work strictly alone on this.<p>

Create a class diagram for the Manufacturing Plant Controller from page 482 of the textbook.<p>

Show all associations, attributes, generalizations, and any operations other than ones to simply set and get associations and attributes.<p>


<hr>






<h2>Assgnments 5 and 7 </h2>

For these assignments, you will develop a very simple application of your choice. The application will build on top of OCSF and also involve implementing a few classes from a UML diagram. You will have clients that can send commands to the server.<p>

The server responds to the commands in some way. The server will likely
also have to send commands/acknowledgements back to the client. You can
<em>either</em> also create a simple graphical user interface for the clients or else make a simple textual UI, but add some other feature of your choice in the server. The TA will judge your work based on quality, amount of work, and innovative ideas.<p>

You can assume that all the data will simply be saved in the memory of the server (i.e. Java objects. I.e. you will not need to worry about making the data persistent, although if you do that (e.g. using Java persistence, then you will get a 1-point bonus on your overall course assignment component).<p>

Here are some examples of basic, reasonably straightforward applications:<p>

<ul>

<li> Airline reservation: A tool that allows you book a flight. Simplify so there is only one RegularFlight. You will need a 'Manager' client that can add SpecificFlights and a separate 'Passenger' client that can register themselves as a passenger, and add a booking on a flight.<p>

<li>Checking a book out of a library. A librarian client will first have to add some titles and library items. A library-member item can the check them out and return them.<p>

</ul>

For assignment 5, do the following:<p>

<ol>
<li>Create requirements showing the problem statement as well as the
functional, quality and platform requirements for your system. This ought to be between 2-5 pages. See examples in the textbook.<p>

<li>Create a UML diagram of the data you will need to store.<p>

<li>Design the commands that the server and client will understand to
implement the requirements. This will probably be between 2 and 4 pages.
See examples in the textbook.<p>

<li>Explain how you will divide the work amoung the members of your team, and how much time you expect each task to take.<p>

</ol>





Assignmemnt 5 is due 11:20 Wednesday Nov 4.<p>

For assignment 7, do the following:<p>

<ol>
<li>Implement and get your system running. You may use Umple. You will demo this in the labs (dates to be determined later). The TA will schedule a time slot for each group. If bugs occur in the demo you can fix them for the final submission.<p>

<li>Hand in your implementation, as well as revised versions of what you
changed from assignment 5 (i.e. as you discovered bugs).<p>

</ol>

Assignment 7 is due 12:50 p.m. Mon Dec 7<p>


<hr>

<h2>Assgnment 6</h2>

This is an individual assignment. You may not work together.<p>

Please hand this in by 11:20 Wed Nov 25.<p>

<ul>
<li>E158 page 296<p>
<li>E161, page 297<p>

<li>Model the states an IPod (or another MP3 player of your choice) can be in, and the various transitions possible.<p>
</ul>
